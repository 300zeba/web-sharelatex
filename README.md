==============

web-sharelatex is the front-end web service of the open-source web-based collaborative LaTeX editor,
ShareLaTeX. It serves all the HTML pages, CSS and javascript to the client. web-sharelatex also contains 
a lot of logic around creating and editing projects, and account management.
